It scrutinizes transactions to detect suspicious behavior and flags addresses that are potentially related to scams. It does so by monitoring the transaction data for messages that might be indicative of a scam, like \\\"honeypot\\\" or \\\"phishing\\\" alerts, and checks if the sender is already known as a \\\"notifier\\\" (an address that has previously flagged scams). Depending on the content and the sender's status, it creates various types of alerts (SCAM-NOTIFIER-EOA, SCAM-NOTIFIER-CONTRACT, VICTIM-NOTIFIER-EOA, NEW-SCAM-NOTIFIER), and it can promote a regular address to a notifier status if it flags at least two scam addresses.\\n\\nThe bot uses a Neo4j database to store scam-related transactions and keeps track of both notifier addresses and potential scam addresses. The bot supports transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Each alert includes a description of the suspicious activity with high severity and suspicious/exploit type, and it involves metadata such as the addresses involved and any relevant messages.\\n\\nWithout access to the source code bounded by triple quotes, I cannot summarize the actual implementation. However, based on the description provided, it seems that the bot aims to interact with on-chain data and off-chain databases, analyze transactions, and produce alerts that can help users stay informed about possible scams happening in the Web3 space.\",\n",

These alerts include notifications for NFT sales at unusual price differences compared to the floor price, potential phishing sales where the transaction value is below a certain threshold, and alerts for stolen NFTs that may have been involved in a suspected phishing attack.\\n\\nSupported blockchain networks include Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Optimism, Fantom, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and more.\\n\\nThe source code for the bot includes a JavaScript file (`client.js`) that contains functions to determine token prices, retrieve OpenSea floor prices, and handle interactions with the MySQL database for transaction records. It also provides utility functions for fetching the latest transaction records and getting transactions by specific addresses.\\n\\nAdditionally, the source code features test-related scripts for testing the database connection and table creation (`db.test.js`), as well as the bot's transaction handling logic (`agent.spec.js`). Other parts of the source code contain logic for parsing and interpreting different NFT transaction event logs and wrapping them up into a standardized format that can be stored in the database and used for alert generation.\\n\\nOverall, the bot serves as a tool to improve transparency and security in the NFT marketplace ecosystem by flagging transactions that may require further inspection for potential fraudulent activities.\",\n",

It also loads the ML model for scoring and determining scam behavior.\\n\\n2. **Alert Handling (`handle_alert` function)**:\\n   For every alert received that indicates potential malicious activity:\\n   - If the alert comes from known bots that provide either passthrough or combination alerts, the bot decides whether to emit a scam finding immediately or evaluate using the ML model respectively.\\n   - Contract similarity and EOA (Externally Owned Account) association alerts also result in findings if they meet certain conditions, like having a similarity score above a set threshold.\\n\\n3. **Block Handling (`handle_block` and `detect_scammer_contract_creation` functions)**:\\n   At each new block, the bot may emit manual findings about scams from a maintained list, false positives identified by the Forta Community, or new findings from the MetaMask phishing list.\\n\\n4. **State Persistence (`persist_state` function)**:\\n   The bot persists its current state on every block or alert handling to facilitate continuity in detecting scams across multiple blocks or transactions.\\n\\n5. **Transaction Handling (`handle_transaction` function)**:\\n   Detects scammer contract creations which can be direct or indirect (via factory contracts).\\n\\n6. **Alert Finding Emission (`emit_ml_finding`, `emit_passthrough_finding`, `emit_contract_similarity_finding`, etc.)**:\\n   Based on the type of alert and its source, emit relevant findings for potential scams.\\n\\n7. **False Positive Mitigation (`emit_new_fp_finding` function)**:\\n   Emits findings to negate previous detections flagged mistakenly as scams by labeling them as non-malicious.\\n\\n8. **Parsing Alerts (`BaseBotParser` class)**:\\n   A helper class to extract scammer addresses and URLs from the alert events based on a configuration.\\n\\nThe code is organized into several Python files according to functionality:\\n\\n- `agent.py`: The core script with functions to manage alert, block, and transaction handling.\\n- `findings.py`: Definitions for generating findings based on scam detection.\\n- `storage.py`: Utilities for interacting with AWS S3 and DynamoDB for state persistence.\\n- `utils.py`: Helper utilities including error handling, data extraction, and information retrieval.\\n- `web3_mock.py`: A mock interface of the Web3.py Ethereum client for testing purposes.\\n- `base_bot_parser.py`: Implements the parsing of alerts according to a configuration CSV file.\\n- `forta_explorer.py`: Interface to query Forta's API for label data.\\n- `forta_explorer_mock.py`: Mock version of the Forta Explorer for testing.\\n\\nThe code utilizes Forta's SDK to interact with the Forta network and report findings that can be used for on-chain or off-chain scam mitigation efforts.\",\n",

The bot monitors alerts from another bot called the \\\"Scam Detector Feed\\\" and reacts to these alerts by tracking scammer addresses and categorizing the types of threats they represent.\\n\\nWhen the bot identifies a scammer involved in a fraudulent NFT order, it delves into historical data for the past 90 days to see the digital assets that have been transferred to the scammer. It quantifies these assets in USD based on available price data. This process of assessing victims and losses continues daily, for 30 days after the last known activity from the scammer.\\n\\nThe bot supports the Ethereum chain and maps alerts from the underlying Scam Detector Feed into victim loss information. It fires an \\\"info\\\" type alert containing the identified victim address, the scammer address, amounts lost, transaction hash, and details about the lost ERC-721 tokens. Additionally, it provides false positive alerts when it believes previously detected scammers are likely benign.\\n\\nThe source code for the bot is split into different components:\\n- **constants.js**: Defines various constants used throughout the bot's code.\\n- **agent.js**: The main agent file that contains `initialize`, `handleAlert`, and `handleBlock` functions. These handle the bot's initialization, alert processing, and block processing, respectively.\\n- **fetcher.js**: Handles data fetching tasks, such as retrieving transaction receipts, ERC20 prices, NFT floor prices, and others.\\n- **fraud.nft.order.processing.js**: Contains the logic for processing fraudulent NFT orders and updating the state based on these processes.\\n- **storage.js**: Manages persistent storage for the bot, including loading and persisting data to the database.\\n- **findings.js**: Generates the findings that the bot will create based on its analysis, such as identifying victims and calculating associated losses.\\n- **utils.js**: A collection of utility functions to support the bot's operations, such as cleaning objects and checking for false positives.\\n\\nThe bot relies on external APIs and secret keys for fetching data and interacts with Ethereum smart contract event logs to analyze transactions related to the scams.\\n\\nNote: The source code is detailed, and this is a high-level summary.
