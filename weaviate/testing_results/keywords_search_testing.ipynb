By incorporating these sources, the bot can improve its accuracy in identifying potential threats and distinguishing false positives from genuine alerts.\\n\\nThe code demonstrates the bot's interaction with the blockchain by querying blocks and contracts to extract relevant information for analysis. This allows the bot to access real-time data from the blockchain network and perform thorough analysis to detect any suspicious activities or potential threats.\\n\\nFurthermore, the code includes mechanisms for handling exceptions and ensuring the bot's state persistence. This is crucial for maintaining the bot's operational efficiency and reliability, as it allows the bot to continue monitoring and responding to alerts without interruptions.\\n\\nOverall, the bot's primary purpose is to monitor and respond to alerts and blocks in a blockchain network to detect and mitigate potential threats and suspicious activities.
